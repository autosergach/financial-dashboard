# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing.

## Workflow
- Create a feature branch per task.
- Use Conventional Commits (e.g. `feat(api): add summary endpoint`).
- Open a PR with a clear description and screenshots if UI changes.

## Development
- Keep changes scoped and documented.
- Add or update tests for behavior changes.

## Code style
- Prefer small, focused modules and explicit data contracts.
- Avoid tight coupling between layers.
